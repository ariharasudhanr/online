# Spring Boot Shopping Cart Web App

## About

This is a demo project for practicing Spring + Thymeleaf. The idea was to build some basic shopping cart web app.

It was made using **Spring Boot**, **Spring Security**, **Thymeleaf**, **Spring Data JPA**, **Spring Data REST and Docker**. 
Database is in memory **H2**.

There is a login and registration functionality included.

Users can shop for products. Each user has his own shopping cart (session functionality).
Checkout is transactional.

### Maven Wrapper

#### Using the Maven Plugin

Go to the root folder of the application and type:
```bash
$ chmod +x scripts/mvnw
$ scripts/mvnw spring-boot:run
```

#### Using Executable Jar

Or you can build the JAR file with 
```bash
$ scripts/mvnw clean package
``` 

Then you can run the JAR file:
```bash
$ java -jar target/shopping-cart-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

### Maven

Open a terminal and run the following commands to ensure that you have valid versions of Java and Maven installed:

```bash
$ java -version
java version "1.8.0_102"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_102-b14)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.102-b14, mixed mode)
```

```bash
$ mvn -v
Apache Maven 3.3.9 (bb52d8502b132ec0a5a3f4c09453c07478323dc5; 2015-11-10T16:41:47+00:00)
Maven home: /usr/local/Cellar/maven/3.3.9/libexec
Java version: 1.8.0_102, vendor: Oracle Corporation
```

#### Using the Maven Plugin

The Spring Boot Maven plugin includes a run goal that can be used to quickly compile and run your application. 
Applications run in an exploded form, as they do in your IDE. 
The following example shows a typical Maven command to run a Spring Boot application:
 
```bash
$ mvn spring-boot:run
``` 

#### Using Executable Jar

To create an executable jar run:

```bash
$ mvn clean package
``` 

To run that application, use the java -jar command, as follows:

```bash
$ java -jar target/shopping-cart-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

To exit the application, press **ctrl-c**.
